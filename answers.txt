•What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
- The gitignore file is used by git to ignore particular files and changes to these files.
- For example when working on a project you install a number of packages and dependency files which are not needed to 
- store in a repository. We mention all such files in gitignore file.
----For a Java Project-----
*.class
*.zip
*.war
*.rar
*.log
*.ctxt
*.jar
*.ear
are some of the extentions which we put in a ignore file

•Why should you have different branches?
The main reason for having branches is to avoid disrupting a running software.
When we work in a team it is convenient and safe to work on individual branches and then merge to the original main branch.
These advantages can be applied to college projects like ours. But when we are working on live project The branching technique offers
a wide range of advantages such as follows
- Maintaining different versions/release
- Different Environment setups
- Tracking changes and easily reverting to running code
- Bug fixes


•In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

Generally there is a Single repository for a single project. The goal of version control tools like is so that we can a single source of repository
for our software projects. This single source can be further branch further according to need and usage. There is no point of making multiple repositories for 
a single project as the purpose of version control itself is to keep track of files and Maintaining a single source code.
